# RecipeExplorer üç¥

**RecipeExplorer** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and hosted entirely on **AWS**. The project demonstrates the power of AWS cloud services for building scalable, secure, and high-performance applications. Below is a detailed breakdown of how AWS services are utilized in this project.

## AWS Services Utilized üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
   - **Purpose**: Store recipe images (e.g., `recipeImage` field in the Recipe schema).
   - **Implementation**:
     - Images uploaded by users are stored in an S3 bucket.
     - Each image is assigned a unique URL, which is stored in DynamoDB.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Scalable and durable object storage.
     - Integrated with **CloudFront** for fast content delivery.

### 2. **Amazon DynamoDB**
   - **Purpose**: Store user and recipe data.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Two tables are created:
       - `User`: Stores user information (`userID`, `userName`, `email`, `password`).
       - `Recipe`: Stores recipe details (`recipeID`, `userID`, `title`, `description`, `ingredients`, `category`, `upvotes`, `recipeImage`).
   - **Benefits**:
     - Fully managed NoSQL database.
     - High performance with low latency.
     - Auto-scaling based on demand.

### 3. **AWS Lambda**
   - **Purpose**: Serverless functions for backend operations.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Lambda functions are used for:
       - Recipe CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).
   - **Benefits**:
     - Pay-as-you-go model.
     - Automatic scaling based on traffic.

### 4. **Amazon CloudFront**
   - **Purpose**: Content delivery network (CDN) for serving static assets.
   - **Implementation**:
     - CloudFront is configured to distribute recipe images stored in S3.
     - Ensures low-latency access to users globally.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Faster content delivery.
     - Reduced load on the origin server (S3).

### 5. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
   - **Purpose**: Host the MERN stack application.
   - **Implementation**:
     - The backend (Node.js/Express.js) and frontend (React) are hosted on EC2 instances.
     - An **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** is created for quick deployment.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Scalable compute capacity.
     - Full control over the virtual server environment.

### 6. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
   - **Purpose**: Manage permissions and roles for AWS resources.
   - **Implementation**:
     - IAM roles and policies are created to grant access to:
       - S3 buckets for image uploads.
       - DynamoDB tables for data storage.
       - Lambda functions for execution.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Fine-grained access control.
     - Enhanced security for AWS resources.

### 7. **Amazon CloudWatch**
   - **Purpose**: Monitoring and auditing.
   - **Implementation**:
     - CloudWatch is used to monitor:
       - Lambda function performance.
       - EC2 instance health.
       - API Gateway metrics.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Real-time insights into application performance.
     - Automated alerts for anomalies.

### 8. **AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
   - **Purpose**: Isolate and secure the application infrastructure.
   - **Implementation**:
     - A VPC is created with:
       - Public and private subnets.
       - An **Internet Gateway** for external communication.
       - **Security Groups** to control inbound/outbound traffic.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Enhanced network security.
     - Isolation of resources.

### 9. **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure high availability and scalability.
   - **Implementation**:
     - ASG is configured to automatically scale EC2 instances based on traffic.
     - ELB distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Improved fault tolerance.
     - Seamless handling of traffic spikes.

### 10. **AWS SDK**
   - **Purpose**: Integrate AWS services with the application code.
   - **Implementation**:
     - The AWS SDK is used in the backend to interact with:
       - S3 for image uploads.
       - DynamoDB for data storage.
       - Lambda for serverless functions.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Simplified integration with AWS services.
     - Programmatic access to AWS resources.
